To use the trained and tested neural network for practical problem-solving with new input data, you can follow the following steps:

1.  Load the saved trained model using the load_model function from Keras.
2.  Load the new input data that needs to be predicted and preprocess it in the same way as the training data using the StandardScaler object created earlier.
3.  Reshape the preprocessed input data to match the input shape of the trained model.
4.  Use the predict method of the loaded model to make predictions on the new input data.
5.  Visualize the predictions using any suitable method such as a scatter plot.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates these steps:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the saved trained model
model = load_model('path/to/saved/model.h5')

# Load and preprocess the new input data
new_data = pd.read_csv('path/to/new/data.csv')
X_new = new_data[['OPEN', 'MIN', 'MAX', 'VOLUME']].values
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_new = scaler.fit_transform(X_new)
X_new = X_new.reshape(X_new.shape[0], X_new.shape[1], 1)

# Use the trained model to make predictions on the new input data
y_pred = model.predict(X_new)

# Visualize the predictions
plt.scatter(new_data['CLOSE'], y_pred)
plt.xlabel('True Values')
plt.ylabel('Predictions')
plt.show()


In this example, we assume that the new input data is stored in a CSV file named data.csv and located in the same directory as the script. The code loads the saved model from the file saved/model.h5, preprocesses the new input data using the same StandardScaler object used for training, and makes predictions using the predict method of the loaded model. Finally, the predictions are visualized using a scatter plot.
